# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

# Local ==> Remote

to do this, we will first create a directory on the local machine. Touch our files into the directory, edit them,then make our first Git commit. To do this, we will initialize Git in the directory. We will then add the desired files and make our first commit. After doing so, we will create a repository on github. Name the repository and click SSH and then create. Copy the "Push an existing repository from the command line" text. Paste it in the terminal.
